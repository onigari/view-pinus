This simple script written in Python3 allows you to enter the length of your pinus and then view it!
To get started on engaging in all sorts for weird fantasies first download the script and then run it! If you don't know how to run a python script just google it!
Assuming you've downloaded the script and googled how to run it (and done what google told you to), enter your desired length and you can finally view with your own eyes what has been bestowed upon you.
